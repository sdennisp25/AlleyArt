# Alley Art

## Trilogy Boot-Camp Final Project

### About the App:
Alley Art is a street smart art app. It allows street artists to create profiles, upload pictures, and opt to communicate with the public. On the other side, users can search for art by either location or artist. Once the user has located art, they can map locations using google maps, view the artist's profile, or save art to favorites. 

So, look up art and go on adventure!
